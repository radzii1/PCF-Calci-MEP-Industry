# ‚ôªÔ∏è MEP Sector PCF Calculator (Scope 1, 2, 3)

This is a Streamlit-based web application built to visualize and estimate **product carbon footprints (PCF)** for various materials, fuels, utilities, and activities relevant to the **MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) sector**, based on **Scope 1, 2, and 3** emission factors.

###  Features

- Interactive selection of:
  - Scope (1 / 2 / 3)
  - Category (e.g., Fuel, Material, Logistics)
  - Item (e.g., Diesel, Steel, Paper, Electricity)
- User input for quantity to calculate estimated CO‚ÇÇ emissions
- Real-time emission calculation
- Visual bar chart for comparative emission factor insight

###  Dataset

Emission factors are based on industry and UAE-specific standards where applicable. The dataset includes over 20 common MEP-related items (e.g., Diesel, Steel, R-134a, Electricity, Paper, Truck Transport).

###  Example Use

- Want to know how much CO‚ÇÇe 100 liters of diesel emits?
- Curious about refrigerant leakage impact?
- Planning paper reduction initiatives and want to quantify Scope 3 savings?

This tool helps engineers, sustainability analysts, and consultants make informed decisions.
